# Simple Monte Carlo Simulation in Java

This Program opens a Playground, where a circle with the radius of a and a Rectangle with the size
of a is placed. It then randomly drops balls and calculates if the would fit inside of either of these
Objects while counting the ones, which are landing inside of each object. After X amount of balls,
it divides the "weight" of circle against rectangle, and the resulting number is close to PI.
